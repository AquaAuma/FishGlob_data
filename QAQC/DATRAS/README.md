## **QAQC for DATRAS**

* **Length Types**: checking the length distribution for deep water fish taxa that might not be reported as total length across surveys. The list of the length conversions and taxa concerned at in the **length_weight** folder
* **Swept Areas**: comparing the fishglob swept areas and ICES swept areas calculations and estimations per survey
* **Re-estimation of weights**: comparing the weight estimated from the abundance at length per survey versus the reported weight. Known units issues of the reported weight is creating the bias observed
