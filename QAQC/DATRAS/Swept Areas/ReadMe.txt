This data output should be used in conjunction with ICES advice for the 
OSPAR request to generate swept area and abundance index outputs for all 
otter and beam trawl surveys in the Northeast Atlantic and regional seas 
based on DATRAS data as input to OSPAR common indicator. The ICES advice can be 
found here: https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.8281

The data output for Component 1 of the request includes:
- The Flexfiles downloaded from DATRAS in the date of calculation
- The Input and outputs from the approach previously used by OSPAR (modified by Kelly 2021 from Moriarty 2016)
which include DATRAS HH downloads, QA outputs and Regional Boundaries Maps and data.
- File hh_swept_area, input needed to run the script "swept_area_modelling.R"
- The final Data product SweptAreaAssessmentOutput.csv, which is also available from 
https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/Download/Download_Data_public.aspx
